## Overview

This repository hosts an interactive web-based roadmap for becoming a professional AI Engineer. It's designed to be a self-guided journey, allowing users to track their progress through various phases, from foundational programming and mathematics to advanced AI concepts, MLOps, cloud deployment, and career preparation.

The roadmap is built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, with progress tracking stored locally in your browser.
